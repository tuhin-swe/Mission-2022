                <p>My vision is to be an honest, empathetic and impactful project leader and to be recognized
                    internationally within my industry. I am committed to growing as a leader and delivering value-added
                    projects to the end users. My mission is to create and lead a dream team where everyone is playing
                    to their strengths.</p>

                        values and aspirations, and that it makes you feel really good and inspired when you read it
                        aloud. </p>

                    <p>In order to get the most value from this exercise I suggest you combine the two into a vision and
                        mission statement. Define the overall essence of what you want to achieve.</p>

                <h1>Develop <br> Without Limits</h1>
                <p>Imagine that you are managing and leading the project of your dreams. Envision that everything is
                    exactly the way you want it to be: the type of project you are running, the industry it is in, its
                    size and complexity, the people involved, and your own capabilities as a project manager and leader.
                    Imagine that you are every bit as successful as you want to be. Feel it and see it.

                <p>As your view of yourself and the future changes, it is important that you review, update and refine
                    your vision and mission statement at least once every six months. If you feel really inspired, you
                    may even want to expand it with more detail and turn it into a personal development plan. So get
                    scribbling and imagine how nice it will be to start out in January with a clear roadmap for where
                    you want to go and how to get there!
